== PROJECT: TravelBanker

---

== Overview

This is a desktop application allowing people, particularly travellers, to keep track of amounts of money
 lent or borrowed to or from contacts. User interactions are command-line based, but the app also consists of
 of a GUI created with JavaFX, which includes a command box, a browser panel, a status bar footer, a list panel
 and more. It is written in Java.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: Implemented a bundle of commands and a map functionality that allow user to get quick and
accurate insight on the state of his finances as well as finding solutions on settling his books.
** What it does: When the app is launched, an automatic search for a nearby ATM is performed. This allows the user
to quickly identify where he can go to get cash to either lend money to his travel companions or get money to reimburse
his debts. The balance command allows the user to quickly establish how much money he owes/is owed in total, which
establishes how much money he should take from an ATM. These two features coupled together already give the user quick
and effective ways to keep track of his travel finances and adjust them, which is the primary objective of the app.
** Highlights: The select command now automatically performs a search for the address of the contact that is viewed.
To perform a search for a nearby ATM, user simply has to type `map` or `mp`, if the browser panel is not already
displaying it (e.g. after a select command). In addition, the `balance` command displays the user's general balance,
while the `min` command can quickly identify the person that owes the user the most money. The `min` command displays
the address of the selected contact as well.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Improve the user experience by implementing a `searchtag` command and implemented shortcuts
 for every command of v1.0 and subsequent commands I have written, as well coloring tags to improve readability of contacts.
** Highlights: Along with tag coloring, included a `searchtag` or `st` command that lists all people that contain
all specified tags. This allows the user to have a quick overview of balances owed by people with specific tags and
labelled with specific currencies. (e.g. view only amounts owed by friends or view only amounts in SGD).
This, once more, contributes to the general purpose of TravelBanker, by giving the user the possibility to view only
amounts that he/she deems relevant.
